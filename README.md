# Customer Segmentation with K-Means

There are many models for **clustering** out there. In this repo, I will be presenting the model that is considered one of the simplest models amongst them and use it for customer segmentation. Despite its simplicity, the **K-means** is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from **unlabeled data**.

Some real-world applications of k-means:

-   Customer segmentation
-   Understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish
-   Pattern recognition
-   Machine learning
-   Data compression


#### Customer segmentation is the practice of partitioning a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics. It is a significant strategy as a business can target these specific groups of customers and effectively allocate marketing resources. For example, one group might contain customers who are high-profit and low-risk, that is, more likely to purchase products, or subscribe for a service. A business task is to retaining those customers. Another group might include customers from non-profit organizations. And so on.
