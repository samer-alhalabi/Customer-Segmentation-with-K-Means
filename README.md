# Customer Segmentation with K-Means

There are many models for **clustering** out there. In this repo, I will be presenting the model that is considered one of the simplest models amongst them and use it for customer segmentation. Despite its simplicity, the **K-means** is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from **unlabeled data**.

Some real-world applications of k-means:

-   Customer segmentation
-   Understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish
-   Pattern recognition
-   Machine learning
-   Data compression

I will show k-means clustering with 2 examples:

-   k-means on a random generated dataset
-   Using k-means for customer segmentation
